A Linux command

Based on zgrep, it would run top on a system that had been gziped twice. Don’t ask me how that works.

This is ok, you didn’t use a question mark.

zztop should display the activity of each process in a graphical beard UI. longer beards mean more cpu/ram

I think it should be the same as top, but periodically the display should do a 360.
